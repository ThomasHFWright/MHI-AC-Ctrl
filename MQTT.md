# Introduction
The program uses the [MQTT client library](https://github.com/knolleary/pubsubclient) from Nick O'Leary (knolleary).
If you are not familiar with MQTT you find on the Internet endless numbers of descriptions and tutorials. My favorites are [here](https://www.hivemq.com/blog/how-to-get-started-with-mqtt/) and [here](https://www.heise.de/developer/artikel/Kommunikation-ueber-MQTT-3238975.html).
I recommend [MQTT Explorer](http://mqtt-explorer.com/) a great all-round MQTT client that provides a structured topic overview for the first steps.

Please adapt [MHI-AC-Ctrl.h](https://github.com/absalom-muc/MHI-AC-Ctrl/blob/master/src/MHI-AC-Ctrl.h) according to your needs.   

Adapt the server (broker) name and the port if needed:

```
#define MQTT_SERVER "ds218p"  // broker name or IP address of the broker
#define MQTT_PORT 1883        // port number used by the broker
```

If you want to use MQTT authentication enter user name and password:
```
#define MQTT_USER ""          // if authentication is not used, leave it empty
#define MQTT_PASSWORD ""      // if authentication is not used, leave it empty
```

# MQTT topic
The read topic level consists of the MQTT_PREFIX and the function name separated by a slash, e.g. *MHI-AC-Ctrl/Power*.   
For writes the topic level consists of the MQTT_PREFIX, the prefix for set commands (MQTT_SET_PREFIX) and the function name, each separated by a slash, e.g. *MHI-AC-Ctrl/set/Power*.  
You can change MQTT_PREFIX and MQTT_SET_PREFIX, default is

```
#define MQTT_PREFIX HOSTNAME "/"        	// basic prefix used for publishing AC data
#define MQTT_SET_PREFIX MQTT_PREFIX "set/"  // prefix for subscribing set commands
```
Please pay attention to the case sensitivity.

The following data topics/payload are available (prefix is not listed)
They are only published when there is a change of the message. The retained flag is 'true'.
When writing data, the retain flag shall be 'false'!

topic|r/w|value|comment
-----|---|-----|------
Power|r/w|"On", "Off"|Override these if needed with POWER_ON and POWER_OFF 
Mode|r/w|"Auto", "Dry", "Cool", "Fan" or "Heat"|Override these if needed with MODE_AUTO, MODE_DRY etc
Tsetpoint|r/w|18 ... 30|Target room temperature (integer) in °C
Fan|r/w|1 ... 4|Fan level
Vanes|r/w|1,2,3,4,"Swing","?"|Vanes up/down position <sup>1</sup>
Troom|r|0 ... 35|Room temperature (float) in °C.
Tds1820|r|-40 .. 85|Temperature (float) by the additional DS18x20 sensor in °C  <sup>2</sup>
Errorcode|r|0 .. 255|error code (unsigned int)
ErrOpData|w||triggers the reading of last error operating data

<sup>1</sup> When the last Vanes related command was received via the infrared remote control then the Vanes status is unknown and the "?" is published.   
<sup>2</sup> Only available when a DS18x20 is connected (please see the description in [Hardware.md](https://github.com/absalom-muc/MHI-AC-Ctrl/blob/master/Hardware.md)) and in the following line a value > 0 is used.

```
#define TEMP_MEASURE_PERIOD 30 // period in seconds for temperature measurement, enter 0 if you don't use the DS1820 
```

Additionally, the following program status topics are available:

topic    |r/w| value |comment
 --------|---|---|---
fSCK     |r  |unsigned integer|frequency of the SCK pin in Hz during boot
fMOSI    |r  |unsigned integer|frequency of the MOSI pin in Hz during boot
fMISO    |r  |unsigned integer|frequency of the MISO pin in Hz during boot
RSSI     |r  |integer         |WiFI RSSI /Received Signal Strength in dBm during boot
connected|r  |0, 1|ESP8266 connection status to broker
synced   |r  |0, 1|synchronization to SPI rx frame
raw      |r  |byte array of 43 bytes|raw data  <sup>1</sup>
cmd_received|r|"o.k.", "unknown command" or "invalid parameter"|feedback for last set command
reset|w|"reset"|resets the ESP8266

<sup>1</sup>The raw data is a byte array of 43 bytes. The following table shows the structure. The raw data are only published when there is change of the data:

byte |comment
---|---
[0]|frame count high byte
[1]|frame count low byte
[2:21]|rx SPI frame (MOSI) - 20 bytes
[22:41]|tx SPI frame (MISO) - 20 bytes
[42]|number of identical MOSI frames

Publishing of the raw data is per default commented out to reduce broker's work load.   

# MQTT topics related to operating data
MHI-AC-Ctrl can also provide operating data of the indoor and outdoor unit. This data is not needed for daily use, but might be interesting in specific use cases. Operating data is only published when there is a change of the content. The retained flag is 'true'.
The path to the operating data topic can be adapted.

```
#define MQTT_OP_PREFIX "OpData/"    // prefix for publishing operating data
```

Without changes of the path, subscribe to *MHI-AC-Ctrl/OpData/#* for receiving all operating data.   
Currently the following operating data topics in double quotes are supported

```
  { 0xc0, 0x02, 0xff, 0xff, 0xff },  //  1 "MODE"
  { 0xc0, 0x05, 0xff, 0xff, 0xff },  //  2 "SET-TEMP"
  { 0xc0, 0x80, 0xff, 0xff, 0xff },  //  3 "RETURN-AIR" [°C]
  { 0xc0, 0x1f, 0xff, 0xff, 0xff },  //  8 "IU-FANSPEED"
  { 0xc0, 0x1e, 0xff, 0xff, 0xff },  // 12 "TOTAL-IU-RUN" [h]
  { 0x40, 0x80, 0xff, 0xff, 0xff },  // 21 "OUTDOOR" [°C]
  { 0x40, 0x11, 0xff, 0xff, 0xff },  // 24 "COMP" [Hz]
  { 0x40, 0x90, 0xff, 0xff, 0xff },  // 29 "CT" [A]
  { 0x40, 0xb1, 0xff, 0xff, 0xff },  // 32 "TDSH" [°C]
  { 0x40, 0x7c, 0xff, 0xff, 0xff },  // 33 "PROTECTION-No"
  { 0x40, 0x1f, 0xff, 0xff, 0xff },  // 34 "OU-FANSPEED"
  { 0x40, 0x0c, 0xff, 0xff, 0xff },  // 36 "DEFROST"
  { 0x40, 0x1e, 0xff, 0xff, 0xff },  // 37 "TOTAL-COMP-RUN" [h]
  { 0x40, 0x13, 0xff, 0xff, 0xff },  // 38 "OU-EEV" [Puls]
```
To reduce the MQTT load, you can comment out the lines you are not interested. But at least one line must be available.
You can find some hints related to the meaning of the operating data [here](https://www.hrponline.co.uk/files/images/HRP/Catalogues/HRP_NEW_ServiceSupportHandbook.pdf#page=7).    
1 "MODE" seems to be identical to Mode in the first table    
2 "SET-TEMP" seems to be identical to Tsetpoint in the first table    
etc.


# MQTT topics related to last error operating data
Some operating data during the last error are stored in the AC and can be read out.
The path to the operating data topic is defined in   
```
#define MQTT_OP_PREFIX "ErrOpData/"    // prefix for publishing operating data from last error
```

The following data topics are available (prefix is not listed) and will be read when you publish *ErrOpData*.

topic    |value |comment
 --------|---|---
Errorcode|0 .. 255|error code (unsigned int), the following data are only available when error code > 0
MODE|"Stop", "Dry", "Cool", "Fan" or "Heat"
SET-TEMP|18 ... 30|Target room temperature (integer) in °C
RETURN-AIR  |unsigned integer|Return air temperature of the indoor unit in °C

etc. Only few operating data are stored during an error.
